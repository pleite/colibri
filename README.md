**Tiny engine, immense model.** Run **GLM-5.2 (744B-parameter MoE)** on a consumer machine with ~25 GB of RAM — in pure C, with zero dependencies, by streaming experts from disk.

```
$ ./coli chat
  🐦 colibrì v1.0 — GLM-5.2 · 744B MoE · int4 · streaming CPU

  › ciao!
  ◆ Ciao! 😊 Come posso aiutarti oggi?
```

## The idea

A 744B Mixture-of-Experts model activates only ~40B parameters per token — and only ~11 GB of those change from token to token (the routed experts). So:

- the **dense part** (attention, shared experts, embeddings — ~17B params) stays **resident in RAM at int4** (~9.9 GB);
- the **21,504 routed experts** (75 MoE layers × 256 experts + the MTP head, ~19 MB each at int4) live **on disk** (~370 GB) and are **streamed on demand**, with a per-layer LRU cache, an optional pinned hot-store, and the OS page cache as a free L2.

The engine is a single C file (`c/glm.c`, ~1,300 lines) plus small headers. No BLAS, no Python at runtime, no GPU.

## What's implemented

- **Faithful GLM-5.2 (`glm_moe_dsa`) forward** — validated token-exact against a `transformers` oracle (teacher-forcing 32/32, greedy 20/20 on a tiny-random model with the real architecture).
- **MLA attention** (q/kv-LoRA, interleaved partial RoPE) with **compressed KV-cache**: 576 floats/token instead of 32,768 (57× smaller — GLM-5.2 has 64 heads and no GQA).
- **DeepSeek-V3-style sigmoid router** (noaux_tc, routed_scaling_factor), shared expert, first-3-dense layers.
- **Native MTP speculative decoding** — GLM-5.2's own multi-token-prediction head (layer 78) drafts tokens that the main model verifies in one batched forward. Measured **2.00 tokens/forward (100% acceptance)** on structured text. Lossless: output identical to greedy.
- **Quantization kernels**: int8 / packed int4 / packed int2, per-row scales, AVX2, dequant-on-use. Packing validated bit-identical to the int8 container.
- **Batch-union MoE**: in prefill (and MTP verification), each unique expert of the batch is read once and applied to every position that routes to it.
- **Byte-level BPE tokenizer in C** (GPT-2-style with Unicode-property regex, 320k merges).
- **RAM safety**: the expert cache is auto-sized from `MemAvailable` at startup — an honest peak projection (working set, KV, MTP row, reconstruction buffers) so the kernel OOM-killer never fires.
- **Offline FP8→int4 converter** (`c/convert_fp8_to_int4.py`): downloads one shard at a time (~5 GB), dequants (128×128 block scales), requantizes to the engine's container, deletes the shard — the 756 GB FP8 checkpoint never needs to exist on disk at once. Resumable.

## Honest numbers (WSL2, 12 cores, 25 GB RAM, NVMe via VHDX)

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| model on disk (int4 container) | ~370 GB |
| resident RAM (dense, int4) | 9.9 GB |
| load time | ~30 s |
| peak RSS during chat | ~20 GB (auto-capped) |
| cold decode cost | ~11 GB disk reads/token (75 layers × 8 experts) |
| disk ceiling (VHDX random) | ~1 GB/s → ~0.05–0.1 tok/s cold |
| MTP speculation | 2.0 tok/forward measured |

This is not fast. It is a 744B frontier-class model **answering correctly on a machine that costs less than one H100 fan**. Warm cache, pinned hot experts and MTP push the useful-response latency down considerably; the physics of the disk does the rest.

### SSD Wear Warning
Cold starts are heavy on random reads. While reads are mostly safe, the OS page cache can cause writes. Heavy use may accelerate SSD wear, especially on cheaper drives. Use with caution and monitor your drive health.

## Quick start

```bash
cd c
./setup.sh                      # checks gcc/OpenMP, builds, self-tests

# convert the model (resumable, needs ~400 GB free on a real ext4/NVMe path):
./coli convert                  # from zai-org/GLM-5.2-FP8

# chat (RAM budget and expert cache size itself automatically):
COLI_MODEL=/path/to/glm52_i4 ./coli chat
```

Useful knobs (env or flags): `--topp 0.7` adaptive expert top-p (30–40% less disk), `--ngen N` max tokens, `STATS=f`/`PIN=f PIN_GB=g` record expert usage then pin the hottest in RAM, `THINK=1` enable GLM-5.2's reasoning block, `DRAFT=n` MTP draft depth, `TF=1` teacher-forcing validation.

## Got a better machine? Try it — here's what to expect

colibrì was built on deliberately humble hardware (12 cores, 25 GB RAM, NVMe behind a WSL2 VHDX that caps random reads at ~1 GB/s). **Every one of those constraints is a knob your machine can turn up.** The engine needs: Linux (or WSL2), gcc with OpenMP, AVX2, ≥16 GB RAM, and the ~370 GB int4 model on a local NVMe (ext4 — never a network/9p mount).

**How to test it, in order:**

```bash
cd c && ./setup.sh                 # build + architecture self-test (expects 32/32)

# 1) measure YOUR disk the way the engine uses it (parallel 19 MB random reads):
gcc -O2 -fopenmp iobench.c -o iobench
./iobench /path/to/glm52_i4/out-00069.safetensors 19 64 8 0   # buffered, 8 threads
./iobench /path/to/glm52_i4/out-00069.safetensors 19 64 8 1   # O_DIRECT

# 2) chat; watch the per-turn stats line (tok/s, expert hit-rate, RSS):
COLI_MODEL=/path/to/glm52_i4 ./coli chat

# 3) record expert usage, then pin the hottest experts in your spare RAM:
STATS=stats.txt ./coli chat
PIN=stats.txt PIN_GB=20 ./coli chat        # scale PIN_GB to your free RAM

# 4) quality benchmarks (MMLU/HellaSwag/ARC):
./coli bench
```

**Back-of-envelope predictions** (decode is disk-bound: a cold token costs ~11.4 GB of expert reads; MTP speculation roughly halves the effective cost; RAM turns cold reads into free cache hits):

| machine | expected |
|---|---|
| this dev box (WSL2 VHDX, ~1 GB/s, 25 GB RAM) | ~0.05–0.1 tok/s cold — proven baseline |
| native Linux, PCIe4 NVMe (~3–5 GB/s random), 32 GB | ~0.5–1 tok/s |
| PCIe5 NVMe or 2×NVMe RAID0 (~8–12 GB/s), 64 GB (PIN ~40 GB of hot experts) | ~2–4 tok/s |
| 128–256 GB RAM workstation (hot expert set mostly cached) | ~5–15 tok/s, matmul-bound — interactive |

These are estimates, not measurements — if you run colibrì on serious hardware, **please open an issue with your numbers**: real datapoints from better machines are exactly what this project needs next.

## Supporting the project

colibrì is a one-person project, written and tested entirely on a 12-core laptop with 25 GB of RAM — the numbers above are the ceiling of what I can measure at home. If this project is useful or interesting to you and you'd like to support its development (better test hardware translates *directly* into a faster engine for everyone: real NVMe scaling data, bigger pinned caches, int2/int3 quality sweeps on real benchmarks), you can:

- ⭐ star the repo and share it;
- 🐛 open issues with benchmark numbers from your hardware;
- 💬 reach out via GitHub issues if you'd like to sponsor development or donate hardware.

Every contribution, from a datapoint to a disk, moves the ceiling.

## Why "colibrì"

The hummingbird weighs a few grams, hovers in place, and visits a thousand flowers a day. This engine keeps a 744-billion-parameter giant alive on hummingbird rations: 25 GB of RAM, twelve CPU cores, and a lot of disk patience.
